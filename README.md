# Raptor_Eye_Project

This project is included in Capstone II of the *short specialization* curriculum in *Backend* and *Frontend* at Holberton School. It is the final project in the aforementioned specialization.

The project creation modality is to develop a project that has been created by a company collaborating with Holberton **(Velozient)** and that the Holberton staff has chosen and prepared a team of students to develop that project.

The project itself tries to search for information within selected web pages. This information *(job offers in certain positions)* will be treated as confidential data and will be used to select candidates who meet the requirements.

All project documentation is written on the [white papers](), and is stored in the directory of the same name in this repository.
