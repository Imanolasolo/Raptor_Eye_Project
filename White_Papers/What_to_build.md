## What do I want to build?

We want to build a project based on the knowledge gained in the Backend and Frontend specializations of the Holberton curriculum.

Thanks to the Velozient company, we have received a project based on the acquisition and management of data taken from web pages. Especially from pages dedicated to presenting job offers for software developers in their different fields.

So the team has decided to create a Full Stack type web application that encompasses the knowledge acquired so far, for this reason we are going to create a project based on web scraping software  on the PERN technological framework (Postgres, Express, ReactJS and Node JS).
