# Is it possible to build it in less than 2 weeks?

We strongly believe that the first part of the project can be created in 2 weeks, because at Holberton we have acquired sufficient knowledge to develop a roadmap and manage work times based on the experience and knowledge of each member of the team.

For this we have created a wall using the Trello software in which the work carried out, the work to be carried out, the work in process and the necessary documentation for their achievement appear.

In this first stage, we will cover the tasks of:

* **Project creation:** To create a project you have to ask a series of questions, such as What do you want to build? How do you want to build it? What do you want to build it for? When do you want to build it? And who do you want to build it with?

  All these answers are answered in these white papers, previously studied as a team using *AGILE* technology in its *SCRUM* variant.

* **Team creation:** To create this team we have based ourselves on the knowledge acquired in Holberton by each member and identifying the most suitable elements by studying their soft and hard skills by the Holberton staff.

* **Documentation:** In these white papers is all the information available about the project and its future interactions, all created in consideration of the entire work team.

* **Pitch development:** As a first interaction with the public, we have been asked to present the project through slides and a pitch to be carried out electronically because the work team is scattered between Colombia and Ecuador, so it would be difficult to bring them together in one location.

   In this presentation we will present the ins and outs of the project and we will launch it for its development and implementation of the following stages of work.

* **MVP Creation:** To give more weight to the project we are going to create not one but two different MVPs (minimum viable product) to see the development of the Backend and the Frontend and the performance of the work team.
